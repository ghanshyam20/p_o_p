# we are going to discuss about loops in python 


# for loop and while loops

# i will work as temprory variable while looping so that each of the value will assign in i for a moment 
# fruits=["apple","banana","cherry"]



# for i in fruits:
#     print(i)


#so we are goin to print the sum for total student score 




scores=[78,65,89,90,45,23,56,78,90]
# sum=0
# for i in scores:
#     sum+=i

# print(f"the total score is {sum}")



# how should we find the max score from above 


# max_score=0

# for i in scores:
#     if i>max_score:
#         max_score=i

# print("the max score is ",max_score)


# THIS BLOCK CODE WILL HELP YOU TO ADD BETWEEN 1 TO 100 
# score=0
# for number in range(1,101):
#     score+=number

# print(score)
